<p>My Spotify Wrapped this week was entirely expected—the number one song I listened to, without question, was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dlfjohy4GoI"><em>Carnival</em> by Bikini Kill.</a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably foolish or shortsighted to say it&rsquo;s my favorite song, period, because frankly having a favorite song is a fun thought experiment but ultimately an empty statement. I have plenty of favorite songs, tied to specific memories, individuals, psychic moments, deep emotions, even tiny flashes of clarity and inspiration. Seeing <em>This Must Be The Place</em> in <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nP8JhOSps_0">Stop Making Sense</a></em> for the first time. The first time <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBqqeqcJM_0">All My Life</a></em> kicked up on one of my Dad&rsquo;s homemade mix CD&rsquo;s. Getting wistful and sentimental for my grad school life when I stumble into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBS4Gi1y_nc"><em>Windowlicker</em></a> deep in a playlist.</p>
<p>So, there&rsquo;s no such thing as a singular favorite song, at least in my accounting. I do think that <em>Carnival</em> a <em>perfect</em> song, which is distinctly different.</p>
<p><img alt="You, too, can be a graphic designer" src="/images/dither_it_bikini-kill.jpg"></p>
<p>This year I&rsquo;ve been more or less detached from music at large, and spinning in algorithmic circles dictated by whatever Spotify is pushing on me that week. Honestly, I very rarely listen to <em>any</em> music unless I&rsquo;m on a run, and even on the track I&rsquo;ve been tending toward podcasts in 2024.</p>
<p>This is frustrating. I&rsquo;m thinking about abandoning Spotify for a while, but I&rsquo;m apprehensive about losing the music (and especially) playlists I&rsquo;ve curated over the years — these playlists are maybe the most concrete markers of time and place over a five or six year period of my life. They&rsquo;ve been getting thinner and less frequent for a while now. I picked up an iPod Classic to circumvent both the obnoxious dependence on streaming as a platform, but also to foster and rekindle the sense of discovering music, downloading albums, and listening to them straight through as complete expressions. I want to own and listen to my own music, in the way that I did when it was a much more central part of my life. There&rsquo;s a lot of friction in this pipeline, which has prevented me from committing to the iPod on a daily basis. It&rsquo;s essentially functioned as a hard drive so far, because it&rsquo;s unbearably slow to get any new music loaded.</p>
<p>Moments of feeling truly inspired by what I listen to are becoming fewer and far between. <em>Carnival</em> was a major exception.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a minute and a half long, mostly two chords, and atomically perfect; urgent and joyful and sweet and snotty and playful and deadly earnest. It starts by letting you know exactly what it&rsquo;s about:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a song about the seedy underbelly of the carnival<br>
The part that only the kids know about<br>
This is a song about sixteen year old girls giving carnies head For free rides and hits of pot</p>
<p>I want to go<br>
I want to go<br>
I want to go</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What do I mean by perfect? Sonically perfect? Perfectly performed? Perfectly expressed? I tend to think it&rsquo;s all of the above, which ultimately means I think it&rsquo;s perfect because every single component — from Kathleen Hanna&rsquo;s devout bawling, to the fact that it&rsquo;s over almost as soon as it&rsquo;s kicked up — is entirely and perfectly appropriate.</p>
<p><em>Carnival</em> is short, but it&rsquo;s exactly as long as it needs to be to get its point across. It&rsquo;s a song without flourish, it&rsquo;s brass fucking tacks. Direct, cutting straight from a to the bone. It&rsquo;s communication in a laser-straight line. I need to develop this thinking further, but there&rsquo;s something conceptually interesting about linking punk rock (and maybe &ldquo;punk&rdquo; ethos more generally) with something like the Shakers. Purposeful and intentional, making something only if it&rsquo;s useful and necessary, and then making it without ornament or embellishment.</p>
<p>At the same time, <em>Carnival</em> is powerful because it might be cutting, but it&rsquo;s also absolutely joyful and <em>earnest.</em></p>
<p>I think the reason <em>Carnival</em> has dug its hook in so deeply into my heart is that it&rsquo;s a very clear expression in the way that I struggle to articulate. I want my work (writing, art, design, anything) to be as perfect (not thoughtful, but perfect) as <em>Carnival</em>, or <em>Louie Louie</em> — messy, shaggy, but specific and purposeful in every facet. I want to say what I mean, and say it directly, and say it with passion and purpose and delight and wonder. I want to go!</p>
